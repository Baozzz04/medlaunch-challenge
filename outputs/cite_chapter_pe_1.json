Should standards and\ncodes conflict, the most stringent standard or code shall prevail.\nSR.11 The organization, through its senior leadership shall ensure that a tobacco-free policy\nbe developed and enforced campus-wide. Substantial progress toward complete\nconformity shall be demonstrated over time. DNV Healthcare will permit temporary\ntobacco use in the areas of the hospital where patient visits may be abbreviated, in\nbehavioral health units and other areas near the main campus that are not under\nhospital control. In order for this to be permissible the hospital shall obtain from the\nlocal and/or state fire prevention agencies (Authority Having Jurisdiction or AHJ) written\ndocumentation stating that these areas which are to be located outdoors, can be used\nPage 321 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nfor smoking while the hospital continues to demonstrate progression toward a tobacco-\nfree campus over time. (See the PE.1 Interpretive Guidelines for specific direction on\nthis procedure).\nInterpretive Guidelines:\nAnnual reviews of effectiveness of the physical environment management systems, as well as\nany resulting changes to the physical environment management systems, plans, etc. should be\ncompleted within 90-days of the ending of the annual cycle. For example, if the annual cycle\nends on January 31, the resulting evaluations should be completed by May 1.\nTobacco-free Campus\nTo apply for areas in which smoking is acceptable,\n1. The documented AHJ permission shall list:\na. Which specific patient populations are permitted to participate in smoking;\nb. What specific areas will be included in the policy;\nc. Any specific applicable controls (e.g., smokers could be under physician’s orders\nand/or accompanied by a security guard in specific approved areas);\nd. All arrangements/precautions/restrictions that pertain to this special permission.\n2. The organization shall also perform a documented risk assessment of the area in\nwhich tobacco use is proposed including:\na. The specific areas where smoking will be allowed;\nb. The smoking areas are designed and built to resist fire, including but not limited to\nthe landscaping in the immediate area;\nc. The smoking areas are located adequately from windows, air intakes and entrances\nto the facility;\nd. The hospital areas are compliant with NFPA 101, 2012 Chapter 18/19:18.7.4* or\n19.7.4*\nOnce it is established that the arrangements described in the inquiry are endorsed/permitted by\nthe local/state fire prevention agency or AHJ documentation, then the organization can continue\ndemonstrate progression towards a tobacco-free campus while using the AHJ-approved specific\nareas for smoking described in the hospital tobacco-free policy and the AHJ documentation.\nThe hospital policy shall also include plans and/or processes that will be developed and\nmaintained to demonstrate continual progress in achieving a tobacco-free campus.\nLigature risk\nThe presence of unmitigated ligature risks in a psychiatric hospital or psychiatric unit of a\nPage 322 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nhospital is an immediate jeopardy situation. Additionally, this also includes any location where\npatients at risk of suicide are identified. Ligature risk findings shall be referred to the clinical\nsurveyors for further evaluation and possible citation under Patients’ Rights.\nThis standard shall apply to all locations of the organization, all campuses, and all off-site\nfacilities.\nThe organization’s department(s) that is responsible for the hospital’s buildings and equipment\n(both facility equipment and patient care equipment) shall be evaluated for maintaining the\nappropriate work environment and related infrastructure to be safe for all staff, patients and\nvisitors.\nCertain areas of the hospital may be required to have external sources responsible for\nmaintaining treatment areas and the hospital will ensure that these services are provided to\nprovide a safe environment for all staff, patient and visitors.\nFacility Equipment\nFacility equipment shall be maintained to ensure an acceptable level of safety and quality.\nTo ensure an acceptable level of safety and quality, the organization shall identify equipment\nrequired to meet its patients’ needs for both day-to-day operations and in a likely\nemergency/disaster situation, such as mass casualty events resulting from natural disasters,\nmass trauma, disease outbreaks, internal disasters, etc. In addition, the organization shall make\nadequate provisions to ensure the availability and reliability of equipment needed for its\noperations and services. Equipment includes, but is not limited to, facility equipment which\nsupports the physical environment of the hospital (e.g., elevators, generators, air handlers,\nmedical gas systems, air compressors, and vacuum systems, etc.)\nAll equipment shall be inspected and tested for performance and safety before initial use and\nafter major repairs or upgrades.\nAll equipment shall be inspected, tested, and maintained to ensure their safety, availability, and\nreliability. Equipment maintenance activities may be conducted using hospital personnel,\ncontracted services, or through a combination of hospital personnel and contracted services.\nIndividual(s) responsible for overseeing the development, implementation, and management of\nequipment maintenance programs and activities shall be qualified. The organization shall\nmaintain records of hospital personnel qualifications and be able to demonstrate how it assures\nall personnel, including contracted personnel, are qualified.\nAll equipment maintenance policies, procedures, and programs, as well as specific equipment\nmaintenance inventories, activities, and schedules fall under the purview of the hospital’s\nmaintenance personnel who have been assigned responsibility for equipment maintenance by\nthe organization’s leadership.\nOrganizations comply with these requirements when they follow the manufacturer-\nrecommended maintenance activities and schedule. Organizations may choose to perform\nmaintenance more frequently than the manufacturer recommends but shall use the\nmanufacturer-recommended maintenance activities in such cases. When equipment is\nmaintained in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, the organization shall\nmaintain documentation of those recommendations and the hospital’s associated maintenance\nPage 323 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nactivity for the affected equipment.\nAlternate Equipment Management (AEM) Program\nA hospital may, under certain conditions, use equipment maintenance activities and frequencies\nthat differ from those recommended by the manufacturer. Organizations that choose to employ\nalternate maintenance activities and/or schedules shall develop, implement, and maintain a\ndocumented AEM program to minimize risks to patients and others in the hospital associated\nwith the use of facility equipment. The AEM program shall be based on nationally recognized\nstandards of practice and guidelines for facility equipment maintenance.\nAn example of guidelines for physical plant equipment may be found in the American Society for\nHealthcare Engineering (ASHE) 2009 document: Maintenance Management for Health Care\nFacilities. There may be similar documents issued by other nationally recognized organizations\nwhich hospitals might choose to reference.\nDecision to Place Equipment in an AEM Program\nThe determination of whether it is safe to perform facility equipment maintenance without\nfollowing the equipment manufacturer recommendations shall be made by qualified personnel,\nregardless of whether they are hospital employees or contractors.\nIn the case of facility equipment, a Healthcare Facility Management professional (facility\nmanager, director of facilities, vice president of facilities) would be considered qualified. Highly\nspecialized or complex equipment may require specialized knowledge or training in order for\npersonnel to be considered qualified to make a decision to place such equipment in an AEM\nprogram.\nThe organization shall maintain records of the qualifications of hospital personnel who make\ndecisions on placing equipment in an AEM program and shall be able to demonstrate how they\nassure contracted personnel making such decisions are qualified.\nIn determining whether or not to include equipment in an AEM program, and which maintenance\nstrategies to use in developing maintenance activities and frequencies for particular equipment,\nthe organization shall take into account the typical health and safety risks associated with the\nequipment’s use. Note that the risk may vary for the same type of equipment, depending on the\nsetting within the hospital where it is used.\nAn organization is expected to identify any equipment in its AEM program which is “critical\nequipment,” e.g., physical plant equipment for which there is a risk of serious injury or death to a\npatient or staff person should the equipment fail. Surveyors shall focus their review of an\norganization’s AEM program on critical equipment in that program and the organization’s\ndocumentation of the factors and evidence it considered in developing an AEM strategy for that\nequipment.\nFactors for an organization to consider when evaluating the risks associated with a particular\ntype of equipment include, but are not limited to:\n• How the equipment is used and the likely consequences of equipment failure or\nmalfunction - would failure or malfunction of the equipment hospital-wide or in a\nparticular setting be likely to cause harm to a patient or a staff person?\nPage 324 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nHow serious is the harm likely to be?\no\nHow widespread is the harm likely to be? If harm would be widespread, even if\no\nthe harm to each affected individual is not serious, this would be a cause for\nconcern.\n• Information, if available, on the manufacturer’s equipment maintenance\nrecommendations, including the rationale for the manufacturer’s recommendations.\n• Maintenance requirements of the equipment:\nAre they simple or complex?\no\nAre the manufacturer’s instructions and procedures available in the hospital,\no\nand if so can the hospital explain how and why it is modifying the\nmanufacturer’s instructions?\nIf the manufacturer’s instructions are not available in the hospital, how does the\no\nhospital assess whether the AEM uses appropriate maintenance strategies?\nHow readily can the hospital validate the effectiveness of AEM methods for\no\nparticular equipment? For example, can the hospital explain how it ensures\nthere is no reduction in the quality of the performance of facility equipment\nsubjected to alternate maintenance methods?\n• The timely availability of alternate devices or backup systems in the event of\nequipment failure or malfunction; and\n• Incident history of identical or very similar equipment – is there documented evidence,\nbased on the experience of the hospital (or its third-party contractor), or on evidence\npublicly reported by credible sources outside the hospital, which:\nProvides the number, frequency and nature of previous failures and service\no\nrequests?\nIndicates use of an AEM strategy does not result in degraded performance of\no\nthe equipment?\nGenerally multiple factors shall be considered, since different types of equipment present\ndifferent combinations of severity of potential harm and likelihood of failure. The organization is\nexpected to be able to demonstrate to a surveyor the factors it considered in its risk assessment\nfor equipment placed in its AEM program.\nEquipment not Eligible for Placement into the AEM Program:\nSome equipment may not be eligible for placement into the AEM Program, for one or more of\nthe following reasons:\n• Other Federal law (for example, regulations promulgated by another Federal agency)\nor State law may require that facility equipment maintenance, inspection, and testing\nbe performed strictly in accordance with the manufacturer’s recommendations, or may\nPage 325 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nestablish other, more stringent maintenance requirements. In these instances, the\norganization shall comply with these other federal or state requirements.\n• Other CoPs require adherence to manufacturer’s recommendations and/or set specific\nstandards. For example:\nThe National Fire Protection Association Life Safety Code (LSC) requirements\no\nincorporated by reference at 42 CFR 482.41(b) has some provisions that are\npertinent to equipment maintenance.\n• New equipment for which sufficient maintenance history, either based on the\norganization’s own or its contractor’s records, or available publicly from nationally\nrecognized sources, is not available to support a risk-based determination. New\nequipment shall be maintained in accordance with manufacturer recommendations\nuntil a sufficient amount of maintenance history has been acquired to determine\nwhether the alteration of maintenance activities or frequency would be safe. If a\nhospital later transitions the equipment to a risk-based maintenance regimen different\nthan the manufacturers’ recommendations, the organization shall maintain evidence\nthat it has first evaluated the maintenance track record, risks, and tested the alternate\nregimen.\nAlternative Maintenance Frequencies or Activities:\nMaintenance strategies are various methodologies used for determining the most efficient and\neffective maintenance activities and frequencies. Manufacturers’ recommendations may be\nbased on one or more such strategies. An organization may also use one or more maintenance\nstrategies for its AEM program in order to determine the appropriate maintenance, inspection,\nand testing activities and frequencies, based upon the nature of the equipment and the level of\nrisk it presents to patient or staff health and safety. The risk to patient health and safety that is\nconsidered in developing alternative maintenance strategies shall be explained and\ndocumented in the AEM program.\nIn developing AEM maintenance strategies organizations may rely upon information from a\nvariety of sources, including, but not limited to: manufacturer recommendations and other\nmaterials, nationally recognized expert associations, and/or the hospital’s (or its third-party\ncontractor’s) own experience. Maintenance strategies may be applied to groups or to individual\npieces of equipment.\nThe organization is expected to adhere strictly to the AEM activities or strategies it has\ndeveloped.\nBackground Information on Types of Maintenance Strategies\n• Preventive Maintenance (Time-based Maintenance) – a maintenance strategy\nwhere maintenance activities are performed at scheduled time intervals to minimize\nequipment degradation and reduce instances where there is a loss of performance.\nMost preventive maintenance is “interval-based maintenance” performed at fixed time\nintervals (e.g., annual or semi-annual), but may also be “metered maintenance”\nperformed according to metered usage of the equipment (e.g., hours of operation). In\neither case, the primary focus of preventive maintenance is reliability, not optimization\nof cost-effectiveness. Maintenance is performed systematically, regardless of whether\nPage 326 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nor not it is needed at the time. Example: Replacing a battery every year, after a set\nnumber of uses or after running for a set number of hours, regardless.\n• Predictive Maintenance (Condition-based Maintenance) – a maintenance strategy\nthat involves periodic or continuous equipment condition monitoring to detect the onset\nof equipment degradation. This information is used to predict future maintenance\nrequirements and to schedule maintenance at a time just before equipment\nexperiences a loss of performance. Example: Replacing a battery one year after the\nmanufacturer’s recommended replacement interval, based on historical monitoring that\nhas determined the battery capacity does not tend to fall below the required\nperformance threshold before this extended time.\n• Reactive Maintenance (Corrective, Breakdown or Run-to-Failure Maintenance) –\na maintenance strategy based upon a “run it until it breaks” philosophy, where\nmaintenance or replacement is performed only after equipment fails or experiences a\nproblem. This strategy may be acceptable for equipment that is disposable or low cost\nand presents little or no risk to health and safety if it fails. Example: Replacing a battery\nafter equipment failure when the equipment has little negative health and safety\nconsequences associated with a failure and there is a replacement readily available in\nsupply.\n• Reliability-Centered Maintenance – a maintenance strategy that not only considers\nequipment condition, but also considers other factors unique to individual pieces of\nequipment, such as equipment function, consequences of equipment failure, and the\noperational environment. Maintenance is performed to optimize reliability and cost\neffectiveness. Example: Replacing a battery in an ambulance defibrillator more\nfrequently than the same model used at a nursing station, since the one in the\nambulance is used more frequently and is charged by an unstable power supply\nMaintenance Tools\nTools (e.g., hand tools, test equipment, software, etc.) necessary for performing equipment\nmaintenance shall be available and maintained to ensure that measurements are reliable. Tools\nused for maintenance are not required to be those specifically recommended by the\nmanufacturer, but tools utilized shall be capable of providing results equivalent to those required\nby the equipment manufacturer.\nAEM Program Documentation\nFor each type of equipment subject to the AEM program, there shall be documentation\nindicating:\n• The pertinent types and level of risks to patient or staff health and safety;\n• Alternate maintenance activities, and the maintenance strategy and any other rationale\nused to determine those activities; the differences from the manufacturer’s\nrecommended maintenance activities are made explicit, unless the organization is\nunable to obtain the manufacturer’s maintenance recommendations, due to the age of\nthe equipment or the manufacturer’s restricting the availability of its recommendations;\n• Alternate maintenance frequencies to be used, if any, and the maintenance strategy\nPage 327 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nand any other rationale used to determine those frequencies. For equipment identified\nas presenting a very low risk to patient or staff safety, it could be acceptable to not set\na particular frequency but instead indicate a less specific approach, for example, an\ninterval range, such as “every 12 – 24 months.” It could also be acceptable to employ\nperiodic “departmental sweeps” for such very low risk equipment, where equipment\nfunctioning is sampled, and operators are polled about its functionality.\n• The date when AEM program maintenance activities were performed and, if\napplicable, further actions required/taken; and\n• Documentation of any equipment failures (not including failures due to operator error),\nincluding whether there was resulting harm to an individual.) (Note: equipment failure\nthat is due to operator error and which results in an adverse event or near miss shall\nbe documented in accordance with the QAPI CoP, as part of the hospital’s required\ntracking of patient safety-related incidents. However, there is no requirement to include\noperator failures in equipment maintenance documentation.)\nWhen the organization has multiple identical equipment items, the documentation may be\ngeneric to that type of equipment, except that documentation of maintenance activities\nperformed shall be specific to each item of equipment.\nEvaluating Safety and Effectiveness of the AEM Program\nThe organization shall have policies and procedures which address the effectiveness of its AEM\nprogram. In evaluating the effectiveness of the AEM program the organization is expected to\naddress factors including, but not limited to:\n• How equipment is evaluated to ensure there is no degradation of performance,\nparticularly for equipment where such degradation may not be readily apparent to staff\nusing the equipment, e.g., miscalibration.\n• How incidents of equipment malfunction are investigated, including:\nWhether or not the malfunction could have been prevented, and what steps will\no\nbe taken to prevent future malfunctions; and\nHow a determination is made whether or not the malfunction resulted from the\no\nuse of an AEM strategy;\n• The process for the removal from service of equipment determined to be unsafe or no\nlonger suitable for its intended application; and\n• The use of performance data to determine if modifications in the AEM program\nprocedures are required.\nEquipment Inventory\nAll hospital facility equipment, regardless of whether it is leased or owned, and regardless of\nwhether it is maintained according to manufacturer recommendations or is in an AEM program,\nis expected to be listed in an inventory which includes a record of maintenance activities. For\nlow cost/low risk equipment, such as housekeeping cleaning equipment, it is acceptable for the\nPage 328 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\ninventory to indicate under one item the number of such pieces of equipment in the hospital,\ne.g., “15 vacuum cleaners for cleaning patient rooms and common areas.”\nIf the organization is using an AEM program, the equipment managed through that program\nshall be readily separately identifiable as subject to AEM. Critical equipment, whether in an AEM\nprogram or not, shall also be readily identified as such.\nTo facilitate effective management, a well-designed equipment inventory contains the following\ninformation for all equipment included. However, hospitals have the flexibility to demonstrate\nhow alternative means they use are effective in enabling them to manage their equipment:\n• A unique identification number;\n• The equipment manufacturer;\n• The equipment model number;\n• The equipment serial number;\n• A description of the equipment;\n• The location of the equipment (for equipment generally kept in a fixed location);\n• The identity of the department considered to “own” the equipment;\n• Identification of the service provider;\n• The acceptance date; and\n• Any additional information the hospital believes may be useful for proper management\nof the equipment.\nSurveyor Guidance:\nThe survey team will delegate one surveyor to review and evaluate the physical environment of\nthe hospital. However, each surveyor, during their respective review of areas within the hospital,\nshould assess the hospital’s compliance with the physical environment standards. If warranted,\nbased upon the size and complexity of services provided, the Life Safety Code may be reviewed\nand evaluated separately by a qualified surveyor.\nVerify that the condition of the organization is maintained in a manner to assure the safety and\nwellbeing of patients (e.g., condition or ceilings, walls, and floors, presence of patient hazards,\netc.).\nReview the organization’s routine and preventive maintenance schedules to determine that\nongoing maintenance inspections are performed and that necessary repairs are completed.\nVerify that the organization has developed and implemented a comprehensive plan to ensure\nthat the safety and wellbeing of patients are assured during emergency situations.\nObserve the facility layout and determine if the patient’s needs are met. Toilets, sinks,\nPage 329 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nspecialized equipment, etc. should be accessible.\nReview areas where current construction, repairs, or improvement operations are taking place\nand validate that the Guidelines for Design and Construction of Hospitals and Health Care\nFacilities, NFPA 101-2012 standards, and State and local building and fire codes are being\nfollowed.\nIf construction, repairs, or improvement operations are taking place and affects occupied areas,\nverify that the hospital as made provisions for the respective elements as described in the\nInterpretive Guidelines (above).\nIf there is no renovation or construction taking place within the organization, verify that the\norganization has a process to follow the current edition of the Guidelines for Design and\nConstruction of Hospitals or Outpatient Facilities, published by the Facility Guidelines Institute\n(FGI), implements alternative life safety measures and includes the infection control practitioner\nand has the resources to account for utility requirements, and eliminating, to the extent possible,\nnoise and vibration.",
