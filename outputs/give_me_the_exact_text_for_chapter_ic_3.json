The development and\nimplementation of both the infection control and antibiotic stewardship programs should include\nleadership support and accountability via the participation of the medical director, pharmacy\ndirector, nursing and administrative leadership, and individuals with designated responsibility for\nthe infection control program and the antibiotic stewardship program; however the governing\nbody or responsible individual is responsible to demonstrate the implementation, success, and\nsustainability of such activities.\nCMS does not specify either the number of infection preventionist(s)/infection control\nprofessional(s) to be designated or the number of infection preventionist(s)/infection control\nprofessional(s) hours that shall be devoted to the infection prevention and control programs.\nHowever, resources shall be adequate to accomplish the tasks required for the infection\nprevention and control program. In organizations with more than one infection\npreventionist(s)/infection control professional(s), the staff members should work as an\nintegrated team to ensure the functions of an infection prevention and control program are\ncovered. A prudent organization would consider patient census, characteristics of the patient\npopulation, and complexity of the healthcare services it offers in determining the size and scope\nof the resources it commits to infection prevention and control.\nCMS does not specify either the number of antibiotic stewardship staff to be designated or the\nnumber of antibiotic stewardship hours that shall be devoted to the antibiotic stewardship\nprograms. However, resources shall be adequate to accomplish the tasks required for the\nantibiotic stewardship program. In organizations with more than one antibiotic stewardship staff\nmember, the staff members should work as an integrated team to ensure the functions of an\nantibiotic stewardship program are covered. A prudent organization would consider patient\ncensus, characteristics of the patient population, and complexity of the healthcare services it\noffers in determining the size and scope of the resources it commits to antibiotic stewardship.\nSHEA has studies and recommendations on resource allocation that organizations may find\nuseful.\nThe organization is required to coordinate internally among all components responsible for\ninfection control and antibiotic stewardship including, but not limited to, the infection prevention\nand control program, the antibiotic stewardship program, the QAPI program, the medical staff,\nnursing services, laboratory services, and pharmacy services.\nThe organization’s governing body, the medical staff, and the director of nursing shall ensure\nthat the organization-wide Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) program\nand staff in-service training programs address problems identified through the infection\nprevention and control program and the antibiotic stewardship program.

and,\nSR.2d A qualified individual (or individuals) with expertise in infection prevention and\ncontrol and in antibiotic stewardship has been designated at the organization as\nresponsible for:\nSR.2d(1) Communicating with the unified infection prevention and control and\nantibiotic stewardship programs;\nSR.2d(2) Implementing and maintaining the policies and procedures governing\ninfection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship as directed\nby the unified infection prevention and control and antibiotic\nstewardship programs: and,\nSR.2d(3) Providing education and training on the practical applications of\ninfection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship to\norganization staff.\nInterpretive Guidelines:\nThe hospital shall have an infection prevention and control program and antibiotic stewardship\nprogram for the entire hospital (including all campuses, provider-based locations, satellites,\nremote locations, etc.). In the case of a hospital system, it is permissible for the system to have\nunified and integrated infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs\n(hereafter referred to as a “unified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship”)\nfor multiple, separately certified hospitals.\nIf the hospital uses a unified and integrated program that it shares with other hospitals that are\npart of a multi-hospital system, this does not change the requirement that each separately\ncertified hospital is held responsible and accountable to the system’s governing body for\nmeeting all of the requirements of an infection prevention and control program and antibiotic\nstewardship program as outlined in the regulations at §482.42.\nAlthough a hospital system has the flexibility to develop a unified and integrated infection\nprevention and control program and antibiotic stewardship program for all of the separately\ncertified hospitals within its system, there shall be evidence that the system wide programs have\ntaken in to account the significant differences in patient populations and services offered that\nprovide unique circumstances for each member hospital.\nThe unified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs shall develop\nand implement policies and procedures for each certified hospital to address the needs and\nconcerns of each hospital separately. The practice and location of the hospital shall be given\nconsideration when developing these policies and procedures.\nEach hospital shall also demonstrate that the unified and integrated programs have\nmechanisms in place to ensure that issues localized to particular hospitals in the system are\nalso considered and addressed. Therefore, each hospital should be able to identify and address\nQAPI issues particularly specific to their hospital in addition to any of the issues being\nPage 277 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\naddressed in the unified and integrated programs.\nThe hospital shall designate an individual or group of individuals with expertise in infection\nprevention and control and antibiotic stewardship. This individual or group of individuals are\nresponsible for communicating, implementing, and maintaining the policies and procedures\ngoverning infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship. They are directed by the\nunified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs. Additionally, they\nare responsible for providing education and training on the practical applications of infection\nprevention and antibiotic stewardship to hospital staff.\nSurveyor Guidance:\nReview the infection prevention and control program and antibiotic stewardship program and\nidentify unified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship policies and activities\nand how these take into account the hospitals population and services offered.\nIdentify the process for which the hospitals’ population and services are integrated into the\ninfection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs.\nReview the infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs and identify\nunified infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship policies and procedures and\nidentify how each separately certified hospital’s unique needs and areas of concern have been\nconsidered in the development of those policies and procedures.\nReview the QAPI program and identify unified QAPI elements and identify QAPI elements that\nare unique to the particular hospital.\nIdentify the process for which these unique elements are integrated into the QAPI program.\nReview governing body policies for evidence that a qualified individual(s) has/have been\ndesignated as responsible for communicating with the unified infection prevention program and\nantibiotic stewardship program, for implementing and maintaining policies and procedures\ngoverning the infection prevention and control and antibiotic stewardship programs, and training\nof hospital staff.\nReview documentation that the designated individual(s) communicate(s) with the unified\nprogram leadership related to issues with infection prevention and antibiotic stewardship.\nReview hospital training documents related to education in infection prevention and antibiotic\nstewardship as evidence of training of hospital staff.\nPage 278 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nMEDICAL RECORDS SERVICE (MR)\nThe organization shall have a medical record service that has administrative responsibility for\nmedical records. A medical record shall be maintained for every individual evaluated or treated\nin the organization.",
