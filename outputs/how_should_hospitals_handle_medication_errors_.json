  "query_type": "question",
  "answer": "Based on the NIAHO Standards, hospitals should handle medication errors through a comprehensive, systematic approach:\n\n1. Reporting and Immediate Action\nAccording to MM.6 (SR.2 and SR.3), hospitals must:\n- Develop procedures for reporting transfusion reactions, adverse drug reactions, and medication errors\n- Immediately report drug preparation, administration, and prescribing errors to the attending physician\n- Track and analyze all medication-related errors to determine their causes\n\n2. Patient Safety System\nAs outlined in QM.8 (SR.2), the organization's patient safety system for medication errors should include:\n- Detection, reporting, investigation, and response to medical errors\n- Aggregation, trending, and analysis of error data\n- Implementation of preventative and corrective actions\n- Defined processes to reduce risk\n- Ongoing measurement of action effectiveness\n- Feedback and learning throughout the hospital\n- Policy for informing patients/families about unexpected adverse events\n\n3. Analysis and Improvement\nThe hospital should:\n- Use a systematic approach to determine the root cause of errors (QM.8 Interpretive Guidelines)\n- Develop and implement preventive actions such as:\n  * Changes in policies and procedures\n  * Staff education and training\n  * Equipment repairs or replacements\n\n4. Reporting Culture\nThe standards emphasize adopting a non-punitive reporting system focused on system improvement rather than individual blame (MM.6 Interpretive Guidelines).\n\n5. Continuous Evaluation\nHospitals must periodically:\n- Collect data on medication errors\n- Analyze the effectiveness of implemented changes\n- Ensure improvements are sustained over time\n\nImportantly, not every medical error results in patient harm, and near misses should also be tracked and analyzed to identify potential system weaknesses.",
