  "exact_text": "QM.1 RESPONSIBILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY\nSR.1 The governing body (or organized group or individual who assumes full legal authority\nand responsibility for operations of the hospital), medical staff, and administrative\nofficials are responsible and accountable for ensuring the following:\nSR.1a The organization develops, implements and maintains an ongoing, hospital-wide,\ndata-driven effective quality management system (QMS) and integrates the\nQuality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI) program into the\nQMS.\nSR.1a(1) This system shall manage and improve performance, patient safety,\nand overall quality of patient care and operations.\nSR.1a(2) For hospitals that offer obstetrical services, the hospital shall utilize its\nquality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program to\nanalyze data and quality indicators collected for the QAPI program by\ndiverse subpopulations as identified by the hospital among obstetrical\npatients. (Note: This requirement shall be implemented by January 1,\n2027)\nSR.1b Clear expectations for safety are established and communicated hospital-wide\n(see QM.8).\nSR.1b(1) All staff, including contract staff and volunteers, shall adhere to the\npolicies and procedures of the organization.\nSR.1b(2) All clinical staff shall implement or clarify, as needed, patient care\norders.\nSR.1c Adequate resources are allocated for measuring, assessing, improving, and\nsustaining the hospital's performance and reducing risk to patients.\nSR.1d Corrective and preventive actions are implemented, measured and monitored for\neffectiveness and sustainability.\nSR.1e As a part of the QMS for addressing performance improvement and patient\nsafety, the organization shall select projects or similar activities that focus\nattention on various processes, functions and areas of the organization.\nSR.1e(1) The number and scope of these projects or similar activities will be\nconducted annually and be proportional to the scope and complexity of\nthe organization’s operations and services offered.\nSR.1e(1)(i) A hospital may, as one of its projects, develop and implement an\ninformation technology system explicitly designed to improve\npatient safety and quality of care. This project, in its initial stage of\nPage 13 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\ndevelopment, does not need to demonstrate measurable\nimprovement in indicators related to health outcomes.\nSR.1e(1)(ii) For hospitals that offer obstetrical services, the hospital shall\nconduct at least one measurable performance improvement\nproject focused on improving health outcomes and disparities\namong the hospital's population(s) of obstetrical patients annually.\n(Note: This requirement shall be implemented by January 1, 2027)\nSR.1e(2) These projects or similar activities will be documented to include the\nrationale for selection and measurable progress achieved.\nSR.1e(3) If the organization participates in a Quality Improvement Organization\n(QIO) cooperative project, the organization shall demonstrate that\ninformation and supporting documentation is provided to the QIO. If the\norganization does not participate in a QIO, the projects and activities\nare required to be of comparable effort.\nSR.2 In addition to any other Quality Management System standard, the organization is\nrequired to comply with QM.1 at all times as a part of its Quality Management System.\nUntil the organization achieves ISO 9001 Compliance/Certification, the organization shall\nfollow at a minimum the ISO 9001 methodology specified in QM.2 (SR.3).\nInterpretive Guidelines:\nThe organization’s leadership, meaning the hospital’s governing body (or organized group or\nindividual who assumes full legal authority and responsibility for operations of the hospital),\nmedical staff, and senior leadership, are responsible and accountable for the hospital’s QMS.\nThe medical staff may delegate this leadership responsibility and accountability for the QAPI\nprogram to the medical staff executive committee if it has such a committee. Senior leadership\nincludes, at a minimum, the hospital’s chief executive officer, chief operating officer, and the\nchief nurse executive (or equivalent), but would also include other executives in the hospital’s\nadministration. Responsibilities include (see also QM.6, QM.7, QM.8):\n• Periodic review of the QMS\n• Development of a plan to implement and maintain the QMS\n• Review of the progress of QAPI projects\n• Determination of annual QAPI projects\n• Evaluation of the effectiveness of improvement actions that the hospital has\nimplemented\n• Ensuring that clear expectations for safety are established and communicated hospital-\nwide, as well as allocating adequate resources to carry out the functions of the QMS\nand QAPI program requirements.\nThis includes, at a minimum, informing all staff of their specific roles and\no\nPage 14 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nresponsibilities related to patient safety (see QM.8) and quality of patient care\nand operations.\nAll staff, including contract staff and volunteers, shall adhere to the policies and\no\nprocedures of the organization.\nAll clinical staff shall implement or clarify, as needed, patient care orders.\no\nClear expectations for safety shall also be set and communicated to those\no\nproviding services under arrangements or contracts and should be documented\nin the contracts (see GB.4).\nQuality Management System (QMS) is defined by ISO 9000 as part of a management system\nwith regard to quality. A management system is a set of interrelated or interacting elements of\nan organization to establish policies, objectives, and processes to achieve those objectives. The\nmanagement system elements establish the organization’s structure, roles and responsibilities,\nplanning, operation, policies, practices, rules, beliefs, objectives and processes to achieve those\nobjectives.\nThe quality assessment and performance improvement (QAPI) program shall be integrated into\nthe organization’s QMS. When hospital leadership evaluate the QMS, this inherently includes\nthe QAPI program. The terms “QMS” and “QAPI” are used interchangeably throughout the QM\nchapter. Where “QMS” is listed, this also includes the QAPI program.\nThe QAPI program shall provide a mechanism to systematically examine the quality of care\ndelivered and implement specific improvement projects on an ongoing basis for all of the\nservices provided by the hospital. The organization develops its program based on its unique\nneeds, priorities, clinical programs, as well as its own considerations for the health equity needs\nof its patient population. There shall be processes in place to continually identify opportunities\nfor quality and safety improvements and to implement changes that lead to improved outcomes\nthat are sustained over time.\nThe resources dedicated to the QMS (and QAPI program) should be commensurate with the\noverall scope and complexity of the services provided by the hospital. The hospital’s governing\nbody, in collaboration with senior leadership and medical staff, should allocate adequate\nresources to carry out the functions specified in the QM chapter. Adequate resources would\nmean that the hospital provides sufficient numbers of staff (including consultants, as needed),\nstaff time, information systems, and education and training to support all elements of the\nrequired quality and performance improvement activities and projects. In addition, adequate\nmeans that staff should be qualified to perform the functions to which they are assigned.\nQualified also means staff have experience or training in the functions for which they are\nresponsible. The hospital may choose to use qualified and experienced contractors for the day-\nto-day technical aspects of the program, such as data collection and analysis. However, the\nhospital’s governing body retains the responsibility for the ongoing management of the program,\neven when a contractor is used for those functions. CMS does not prescribe a particular formula\nfor determining whether the hospital has allocated adequate resources to its program. However,\nhospitals should be able to demonstrate inclusion of the program in its budget process and\nidentify in detail the resources it dedicates to the program. This includes the resources that a\nPage 15 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\ncontracted service has allocated to support these functions. Additionally, the hospital must be\nable to provide evidence of the number of staff it has allocated to focus on the management and\noversight of the day-to-day program functions.\nPerformance improvement projects are differentiated from performance improvement activities\n(such as that under QM.7) in that performance improvement projects require a significant\namount of up-front planning, include project objectives, and have a definitive beginning and end\ndate (time-limited). Performance improvement activities make up the continuous, ongoing\nfunctions of a hospital QMS related to quality and patient safety, such as ongoing tracking of\nmedical errors and adverse events, analysis of data, implementation of changes with associated\neducation and training, continuous monitoring of quality and safety in all hospital departments\nand service areas, etc.\nCMS does not prescribe the specific types of performance improvement projects to be\nconducted annually. The hospital’s governing body determines the number and types of annual\nprojects based on the complexity and scope of the services provided by the hospital. No fixed\nratio is required, but it is acceptable for smaller hospitals with a smaller number of distinct\nservices to have fewer projects than a large hospital with many different services.\nThe hospital may choose to participate in Quality Improvement Organization (QIO) projects to\nfulfill the annual project requirement but are not required to do so to be compliant with the\nrequirement at QM.1 (SR.1a). QIOs are funded by CMS to promote, through cooperative\nprojects, improvements in services provided by Medicare-participating providers. If the hospital\ndoes not participate in a QIO project, it is expected to implement its own annual projects that are\ncomparable in effort to a QIO project. The hospital should consider the number of patients\naffected, the range of services covered, and the projected magnitude of the benefit to individual\npatients when developing annual projects. (68 FR at 3441)\nThe hospital shall keep records on each performance improvement project completed within the\nprevious survey cycle, as well as a list of projects currently underway. The documentation for\neach project shall, at a minimum, include an explanation of why the project was undertaken.\nThe explanation of the project shall indicate what data was collected in the hospital, or what\npublicly available data and/or recommendations of nationally recognized organizations, leads\nthe hospital to believe that the project activities will result in improvements in patient health\noutcomes and safety in the hospital. For projects that are in progress, the hospital shall be able\nto explain what activities the project entails and how the impact of the project is being\nmonitored. The hospital will provide evidence of baseline data it is collecting (or will be\ncollecting, in the case of projects just beginning) that will enable the hospital to assess whether\nthe project achieved measurable outcomes. For projects that are completed, the hospital should\nbe able to demonstrate that the project resulted in measurable progress toward improving the\nquality of care or patient safety.\nSurveyor Guidance:\nInterview leadership and review program documents (Quality Management Oversight meeting\nminutes, Medical Staff or MEC meeting minutes, governing body meeting minutes, etc.) to\nevaluate how priorities are established, how data is collected and used to monitor and improve\nperformance, patient safety, and overall quality of patient care and operations, and to establish\nexecutive leadership’s oversight of the QMS.\nWhile these leaders are not expected to be directly involved in the day-to-day activities of the\nPage 16 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nhospital’s QAPI program, they should be actively engaged in the oversight of the QAPI program\nthrough their periodic review of the program, including, but not limited to:\n• Development of a plan (e.g., Quality Plan, QAPI plan) to implement and maintain the\nQMS\n• Review of the progress of QAPI projects\n• Determination of annual QAPI projects\n• Evaluation of the effectiveness of improvement actions that the hospital has\nimplemented\n• Planning for QAPI resources\nAsk to see evidence that executive leadership makes the required decisions related to planning,\ndata collection, and projects, conducts regular reviews of information on the performance of the\nQMS, and makes decisions based on that review for the overall direction and management of\nthe QMS (see also QM.2 (SR.3f), QM.6 and QM.7).\nAsk the hospital to provide a list of distinct performance improvement projects the hospital is\ncurrently conducting and has conducted since the time of the last survey to verify the hospital is\nconducting annual QAPI projects.\nReview documentation to validate why each project was conducted and as evidence to support\nthe progress being made on each project.\n• Does the documentation include data to support “why” each project was conducted (e.g.,\nmedical error and adverse event reports indicated a need for improvement in a particular\narea)?\n• Does the documentation include evidence of ongoing monitoring of the project's\nprogress, such as periodic data collection and analysis?\n• Ask the executive leadership to explain how the selection (number and scope) of the\nspecific projects is in alignment with the hospital’s complexity and the scope of services\nit provides.\n• Consider the size of the facility and the intensity of its services, such as critical care\nservices/units, complex surgeries, transplant services, maternal/child health services,\nand oncology services, including radiation and chemotherapy, etc.",
