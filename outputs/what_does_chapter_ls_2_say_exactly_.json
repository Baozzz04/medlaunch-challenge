  "exact_text": "LS.2 POTENTIALLY INFECTIOUS BLOOD AND PRODUCTS\nPotentially human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious blood and blood components can\ncome from a donor who: tested negative at the time of donation but tests reactive for evidence\nof HIV infection on a later donation; tests positive on the supplemental (additional, more\nspecific) test or other follow-up testing required by FDA; and for whom the timing of\nseroconversion cannot be precisely estimated. Potentially hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious\nblood and blood components are the blood and blood components identified in 21 CFR 610.47.\nSR.1 If an organization regularly uses the services of an outside blood bank, it shall have an\nagreement with the blood bank that governs the procurement, transfer, and availability\nof blood and blood products.\nSR.2 The agreement shall require that the blood bank promptly notify the organization of the\nfollowing:\nSR.2a Within three calendar days if the blood bank supplied blood and blood products\ncollected from a donor who tested negative at the time of donation but tests\nrepeatedly reactive for the antibody to HIV or HCV on a later donation; and,\nSR.2b The results of the FDA licensed more specific test or other follow-up testing\nrecommended or required by the FDA completed within 45 calendar days after\nthe donor’s repeatedly reactive screening test for HIV or HCV.\nSR.2c Within 3 calendar days after the blood bank supplied blood and blood\ncomponents collected from an infectious donor, whenever such records are\navailable.\nSR.2d Quarantine of blood and blood products pending completion of testing: If the\nblood bank notifies the organization of the repeatedly reactive HIV or HCV\nscreening test results, the organization shall determine the disposition of the\nPage 163 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nblood or blood product and quarantine all blood and blood products from\nprevious donations in inventory.\nSR.3 If the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more\nspecific test or other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is negative,\nabsent other informative test results, the organization may release the blood and blood\nproducts from quarantine.\nSR.4 If the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more\nspecific test or other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is positive, the\norganization shall dispose of the blood and blood products and notify the transfusion\nrecipients according to LS.3.\nSR.5 If the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more\nspecific test or other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is\nindeterminate, the organization shall destroy or label prior collections of blood and\nblood products held in quarantine (as set forth at 21 CFR 610.46(b)(2) and\n610.47(b)(2)).\nSR.6 The organization shall maintain adequate records which identify the source and\ndisposition of all units of blood and blood components for no less than 10 years from\nthe date of disposition in manner reflecting QM.2 (SR.3b) and are stored in such a\nmanner they are available for prompt retrieval.\nSR.6a The organization will have a plan in place to transfer these records to another\nhospital or other entity if the hospital ceases its operations for any reason. The\norganization will have allocated adequate funding to execute this plan when\nnecessary.\nInterpretive Guidelines:\nThis standard requires that the hospital have a system in place to take appropriate action when\nnotified that blood or blood products received are at increased risk of transmitting potential\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\nDefinition: The timeframe, also referred to as the “window period”, is defined as that period early\nin infection when the antibody to HIV or HCV is not detectable by the screening test.\nDefinition: The term “repeatedly reactive” means that the initial HIV or HCV antibody screening\ntest is reactive, retested in duplicate, and one or both of the duplicate tests are reactive. If\nrepeatedly reactive, a licensed, more specific (confirmatory) test (e.g., Western Blot) is used to\nconfirm the presence of HIV or HCV.\nDefinition: “Look back” is considered to include: the quarantine of products from a window\nperiod donor; notification of consignees (facilities having received such window period products)\nto quarantine those products; and on completion of the licensed, more specific (confirmatory)\ntest, notification of any transfusion recipient.\nDespite the best practices of blood banks, a person may have donated blood during the window\nPage 164 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\nperiod. If the donor attempts to donate blood at a later date, the screening test for the antibody\nto HIV or HCV may, at that time, be repeatedly reactive. Under such circumstances, previously\ncollected blood and blood products would be at increased risk for transmitting HIV or HCV and a\nrecipient of blood or blood products collected during the window period would not know whether\nthe donor was infected with HIV or HCV at the time of the previous donations.\nIf the organization regularly uses the services of an outside blood bank, it shall have an\nagreement with the blood bank to govern the procurement, transfer, and availability of blood and\nblood products. This applies to organizations that receive blood and blood products from an\noutside source and only performs compatibility (cross match) testing in preparation for\ntransfusion to patients.\nThe agreement(s) and practice policies developed between the organization and blood bank\nshall be consistent with applicable federal, state, and local laws, and written with the means of\naddressing any changes in FDA or CMS requirements and can be incorporated into operating\nprocedures rather than by constructing a new agreement.\nUnder certain circumstances, such as blood availability emergencies, hospitals may receive\nblood from a source other than the contracted blood bank. FDA regulations require a blood bank\nto notify the hospital in the event it furnished the hospital with potentially HIV or HCV infected\nblood.\nThe agreement between the notification process and procedure shall include the elements as\nstated in LS.2 (SR.2(a) – SR.2(d)).\nIf the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more specific test\nor other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is negative, absent other\ninformative test results, the organization may release the blood and blood products from\nquarantine.\n• The organization’s policy should reflect that release (from quarantine) of potentially\nHIV or HCV infected blood is possible only if the more specific (confirmatory) test is\nnegative, and the blood bank’s (the facility that notified the hospital) records show the\ndonor has no other informative test results that show evidence of HIV or HCV infection.\n“Other” informative tests are tests that a blood bank may voluntarily perform (e.g., HIV\nantigen tests, viral cultures).\nIf the blood bank notifies the organization that the result of the FDA-licensed, more specific test\nor other follow up testing recommended or required by FDA is positive, the organization shall\ndispose of the blood and blood products in accordance with 21 C.F.R. 606.40.\n• If these tests are positive, the blood and blood products are disposed of if still\navailable. The blood bank will communicate this information to the hospital. If no other\ninformative test results exist, the hospital may release the blood and blood products\nfrom quarantine. If other informative test results exist that indicate possible HIV\ninfection, the hospital shall dispose of the blood and blood products.\nSurveyor Guidance:\nThe hospital’s laboratory will be determined to be in compliance with the requirements of LS.2 if\nthe hospital’s laboratory maintains current accreditation through an approved accreditation\nPage 165 of 458\n®\nNIAHO Accreditation Requirements, Interpretive Guidelines and Surveyor Guidance for Hospitals\nRevision 25-1 – Effective September 8, 2025\norganization under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). If the hospital\nlaboratory does not maintain accreditation, then the following shall be verified:\nValidate that the written agreement with the blood bank allows for notification expectations (per\nLS.2 (SR.2) and approval by an appropriate hospital representative.\nVerify the organization’s policy for labeling and quarantining potentially HIV or HCV infected\nblood and blood products. Validate the procedure for the disposal of infected blood products,\nwhen warranted.\nVerify the procedure followed when the hospital is notified that it had received potentially\ninfectious blood and blood products.\nVerify that the organization policy addresses the notification process when it receives potentially\nHIV or HCV infectious blood or blood products.\nVerify that the hospital maintains adequate records which identify the source and disposition of\nall units of blood and blood components for no less than 10 years from the date of disposition in\nmanner reflecting QM.2 (SR.3b) and are stored in such a manner they are available for prompt\nretrieval.\nVerify that the organization has a plan in place to transfer these records to another hospital or\nother entity if the hospital ceases its operations for any reason and that the organization has\nallocated adequate funding to execute this plan when necessary.",
